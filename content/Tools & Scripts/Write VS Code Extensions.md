3. Open the extension folder in VS Code.
4. Write your commands in the file `extensions.js`(or `extensions.ts` depending on the extension type).
5. Edit the `package.json` to link your commands from the `extension.js` with your code. For more information, see [npm: package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json).
6. If yneed to import modules (defined as dependencies in `package.json`), run the command `npm install` in the extension folder.
7. Test the extension by pressing F5, then Crtl+Shift+P to open the command palette and enter the title of your command.

In case of errors, open the Output panel (Ctrl+Shift+U) and select `Extension Host` from the dropdown to troubleshoot.
