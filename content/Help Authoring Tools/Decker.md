[Decker](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Decker) is a multimedia platform for creating and sharing interactive documents, with sound, images, hypertext, and scripted behavior.

Summary:
- It’s essentially a _multimedia hypertext system_, inspired by **HyperCard**, but reimagined for the modern era.
- You build “**decks**,” which are stacks of **cards**.
- Each card can have text, images, sounds, and interactive elements.
- You can script interactivity using [**Lil**](https://beyondloom.com/decker/lilquickref.html), Decker’s built-in scripting language.

## Interactive Documentation with Decker  

Interactive [[Concepts/Documentation]] is all about:
- Linking between sections easily
- Embedding images/screenshots
- Adding forms or fields users can fill in
- Using scripts to respond to clicks, inputs, or other events

With Decker, you can do all that in a single `.deck` file that runs in the Decker app or in the browser (it exports to HTML/JS).
