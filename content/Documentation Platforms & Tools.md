This is a (very) short list of tools and platforms to create [[Concepts/Documentation]].
I divide documentation tools into the following groups:

- [[Documentation Platforms & Tools#Static Site Generators (SSG)]]
- [[Documentation Platforms & Tools#SaaS Documentation Platforms]]
- [[Documentation Platforms & Tools#Self-Hosted Dynamic Documentation Platforms (Wikis)]]
- [[Documentation Platforms & Tools#Help Authoring Tools (HATs)]]
- [[Documentation Platforms & Tools#Component Content Management Systems (CCMS)]]

## Static Site Generators (SSG)

Tools that generate a static HTML/CSS/JS website from Markdown (or similar). Content lives in Git, and you host the site yourself. For more information, see [[Static Site Generators/Static Site Generators]].
Ideal for: Developer documentation, versioned docs, Git workflows, fast static hosting.

Key Features:
- Write Markdown or similar files.
- Build static HTML/CSS/JS.
- Host the output anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3).

Examples:
- [[Static Site Generators/Writerside\|Writerside]]
- [[Static Site Generators/MkDocs\|MkDocs]]
- [[Static Site Generators/Sphinx\|Sphinx]]
- [[Static Site Generators/Hugo\|Hugo]]
- [[Static Site Generators/Astro + Starlight\|Astro + Starlight]]
- [[Static Site Generators/Antora\|Antora]]
- [[Static Site Generators/Docusaurus\|Docusaurus]]
- [[Static Site Generators/Quartz 4\|Quartz 4]]

- [[Self-Hosted Wikis/Wiki.js]]

## Help Authoring Tools (HATs)

Desktop software for producing help files (CHM, HTML Help, PDFs) and manuals.
Ideal for: Software user guides, context-sensitive help systems, offline documentation.

Examples:
- [[Help Authoring Tools/HelpSmith]] – Windows app for CHM, Web Help, PDF.

## Component Content Management Systems (CCMS)

Enterprise-grade tools for modular, structured content creation and multi-channel publishing.
Ideal for: Large organizations where you need to use structured authoring (DITA XML, DocBook, or proprietary XML), reuse content modules across multiple outputs, manage translations and variants and/or deliver multi-channel outputs (HTML5, PDF, Help, ePub, etc.).

Examples:
- [Paligo](https://paligo.net/) (SaaS)
- [SCHEMA ST4](https://quanos.com/en/products/schema-st4/) (Self-hosted / On-premise)
