An LLMs.txt file lets you set clear rules for AI-driven search engines, similar to robots.txt for search engine crawlers. Like robots.txt, these files are typically located at the root of your domain.

Why use LLMs.txt:
• **Content Ownership:** Maintain control over how your website content is used by AI systems.
• **Transparency:** Communicate clear guidelines to AI platforms about access and permissible use.
• **Adaptability:** Tailor permissions for specific AI tools or services.

It's basically SEO for LLMs.
