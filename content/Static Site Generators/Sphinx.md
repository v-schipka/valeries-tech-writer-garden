[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is one of many [[Static Site Generators]] that focus on [[Documentation]]. Sphinx uses reStruturedText and/or [[Markdown]] files to build a local html website. 

## Resources

- [Installing Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html)
- [Getting Started](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html)

## Features

- Supports reStructuredText as well as [[Markdown]] (as an extension). For more information, see [[Markdown vs AsciiDoc vs reStructuredText]].
- Offers functionality to [generate documentation based on docstrings](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/automatic-doc-generation.html) .
- Functionaliry can be extended using [extensions](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html).

Quote from their website:

> Sphinx can also be used to generate blogs, homepages and even books. Much of Sphinxâ€™s power comes from the richness of its default plain-text markup format, reStructuredText.

## My Thoughts

- Quick setup, I like the quickstart option to get started fast
- High learning curve (if you're not a python developer) compared to other docs focused [[Static Site Generators]]
- The table of contents (TOC) configuration was very confusing (probably because I'm not used to it and tried to go the Markdown route), but apparently there are some plugins that make it easier to create TOCs, see [Sphinx External TOC](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-external-toc).
- As a beginner to Sphinx and reStructuredText, I'd recommend using Sphinx with reStructuredText instead of the Markdown extension
