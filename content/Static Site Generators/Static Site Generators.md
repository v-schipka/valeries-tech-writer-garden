Static site generators (SSGs) are software engines that use text input files (such as [[Markup Languages/Markdown]], reStructuredText, AsciiDoc and JSON) to generate static web pages.
Static sites generated by static site generators do not require a backend after site generation. The built html sites can be hosted on any platform.
