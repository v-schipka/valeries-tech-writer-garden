[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/.) is one of many [[Static Site Generators]] that use [[Markdown]] files to build a local html website. 

## Resources

- [Hugo Installation](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/)
- [Hugo Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
- [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
## My Thoughts

- Steep learning curve!
- A lot of themes available (mainly for blogs and websites)
- [Shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) to extend markdown functionalities are useful
- It's FAST!!!
- I'd recomment it for websites/blogs, but not documentation

## What I use it for

I use Hugo together with the [Toha](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/toha/) theme for my blog, see [Valerie's Blog](https://v-schipka.github.io/).
