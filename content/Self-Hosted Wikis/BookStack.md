## Bookstack vs Static Site Generators


| Feature         | BookStack                       | Static Site Generators          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Hosting         | Requires PHP & Database (MySQL) | Any static web host             |
| Content Storage | In database                     | Markdown files in repo          |
| Collaboration   | Built-in editing UI             | Git-based collaboration         |
| Permissions     | Granular user & role management | Depends on hosting platform     |
| Build Process   | Dynamic serving                 | Build static site before deploy |
| Search          | Built-in                        | Depends on generator/plugin     |
| Versioning      | Internal version history        | Git history                     |
-> BookStack is closer in spirit to Atlassian Confluence than to a static site generator.
