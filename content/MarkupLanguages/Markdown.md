Markdown is a lightweight markup language that can be use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. The Markdown syntax in Markdown-formatted files (.md) indicates which words and phrases should look different. It is often used in [[WYSIWYM]] editors. 

- Can be used to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical [[Documentation]].
- Is portable and platform independent. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application and on any device running any operating system.
- Is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.

## Process Markdown Files

To convert Markdown files into HTML, a _Markdown application_ capable of processing the Markdown file is required, e.g., scripts, desktop applications, [[Static Site Generators]], etc. 
The HTML document can then be viewed in a web browser or be combined with a style sheet and printed.

## Markdown Flavors

Practically every Markdown application implements a slightly different version of Markdown. These differences are called _flavors_. 

The differences can be the usage of only basic syntax elements, or all of the basic and extended syntax elements combined, or some arbitrary combination of syntax elements. To get to know a Markdown flavour, it is advised to read the documentation of or start using the Markdown application.

Example Flavours:
- [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- [Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/)
- [MultiMarkdown](https://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/)
- [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

## What I use it for

I use Markdown files for notes in [[Obsidian]] and in the context of [[Static Site Generators]], e.g. in combination with [[MkDocs]] to create online documentations and in combination with [[Hugo]] to write a blog.
