Microcopy are the words in a user interface that directly correlate to the actions of the user:
- the motivtion **before** the action
- the instructions **during** the action
- the feedback **after** the action

For a long time, developers would refrain from adding text to their digital products ("no one wants to read it"). But lately, there is a trend to use good microcopy to:
- better connect with users (create a bridge between human and machine)
- improve usability (by placing microcopy where it is needed to avoid problems, by displaying understanding of the brand and target groups)

Good microcopy consists of:
- [[1 Voice & Tone Design]]
- [[2 Experience & User Engagement]]
- [[3 Usability]]

## Principles

| Principle | Example |
|-----------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Each screen should serve a purpose (keep screens short and eliminate unnecessary steps). |
| **Anticipation** | When writing for apps, ask yourself, “What comes next?” (adjust your tone to the situation). |
| **Context** | For app alerts to be useful and clear, always best be specific about the action the buttons perform, empty states can be occasions for celebration or education, depending on the context and tone of the application. |
| **Empathy** | Write for a wide range of languages and cultures (every element in your app needs to have thoughtful, useful, descriptive text). |

### Motivate Users to perform Actions

1. Focus on added values instead of methods (e.g., instead of "Multiple tools to manage your finances", write "Leave your debts behind", "The registration enables you to arrive at the checkout faster" -> "Register to arrive at the checkout faster", "A new way to buy pre-owned vehicles" -> "pre-owned vehicles - zero effort, full guarantee", etc.).
2. Amuse and excite users.
3. Respect users by inviting them to perform actions (e.g., highlight the advantages of performing certain actions).
4. Make use of social proof (e.g., how many customers have already purchased the product, what product edition was sold most, opinions and success stories of other user, ratings, media presence, etc.)
