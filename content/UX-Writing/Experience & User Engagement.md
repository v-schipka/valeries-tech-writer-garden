Experience & User Engagement focuses on how to apply [[UX-Writing/Voice & Tone Design]] in [[UX-Writing/Microcopy]].

## Registration Forms

- Avoid words like "user", "new user", "existing user", "login for registered users", etc. Instead, speak to users directly and welcome them. 
- Explain the advantages of a registration, e.g., "faster checkout process", "enter your data only once", "financial advantages for registered customers", "track orders, deliveries and your order history", etc.
- Remove worries / obstacles. People usually don't want to register anywhere because it takes time and effort to fill out forms, they don't want to give out email adresses and / or they are worried there will be hidden costs that apply at a later time. Assure them, offer registration via services that are likely already in use, e.g. register using google or social media account.

> [!tip]
> - Use "sign-up" instead of "register" as it suggests a shorter, easier process.
> - Provide instant input validation, e.g., for passwords.
> - Allow switching between login and sign-up

> [!example] 
> Examples for registration form titles:
> - Not registered yet? Then this is the right place for you.
> - Nice to get to know you :)
> - Register now and start... (editing images, connecting with firends, etc.)
> - New here?
> - Let me in!
> - Not a member yet?

## Newsletters

Newsletter invitation are usually divided in 3 categories:
- Boring (e.g., "Subscribe to our newsletter!", "To subscribe to our newsletter, enter your data here")
- We-keep-you-up-to-date (e.g., "don't miss out on new articles", "get to know more about new products and sales")
- Convincing 

Newsletter invitations work the same way sales discussions do. Provide a legit reason or a value to make users subscribe to a newsletter)

- Choose a fitting title
- Explain what users gain when they subscribe to the newsletter
- Remove worries / obstacles (e.g., assure users that newsletters are send out at a low frequency and that their email addresses are secured, because you care about data security)

## Error Messages

- Explain in simple terms that there is a problem and what the problem is
- Suggest a solution so that users can return to the process and finish it
- (Try to) turn the delay into a pleasant experience

Exception: standart errors like a wrong password do not require both explanation and solution as users are likely already familiar with those.

To write a good error message, you need to know the followign information:
- What was the user trying to do when the error occured?
- Why did the error occur?
- What can the user do to continue with the process?
- If there is no solution, can you offer an alternative action?

> [!caution] 
> The more general the error message is, the less helpful it is.

When writing error messages, make sure to be actionable and compassionate.

|Characteristic|Description|
|---|---|
|**Actionable**|Does the error say what happened in simple terms and explain what the user needs to do next to get back on task?|
|**Compassionate**|Do the language and the tone of the message match the severity of the issue and avoid blaming the user for the error?|

## Success Messages

Goals of a success message:
- Assure users
- Instruct users
- Connect with users

Components of a good success message:
- Address your users instead of the action
- Make sure that the user knows that what they were trying to do was successful
- If relevant, take up a meaningful aspect of the action (e.g., if a user subscribes to a newsletter, remind them that it will be available in their inbox soon)
- Present the next step and motivate users

> [!note] 
> Typical scenarios for success messages:
> - Sign-up to a website, community, event or service
> - Purchase of a product or service 
> - Subscription to a newsletter
> - Log out
> - Sending a contact form
> - Import / Export of data or files
> - Email verification
> - Password recovery

## Placeholders

Placeholders are texts within an input field (usually in a lighter color) that are overwritten once the user enters an actual input text. They are not to be confused with labels (the name of the input fields).

- Only use placeholders if necessary (if the label is self-explanatory, there is no need for a placeholder)
- Use placeholders in input fields users are actually expected to fill out
- Use placeholders for input fields that are hard to understand
- Do **not** use placeholders for instructions

Types of placeholders:
- Questions (e.g., "Where are you traveling?" on booking websites, "What are you looking for?" in search bars, etc.)
- Categories (e.g., "destination, hotel name, airport, attraction or address" on booking websites, "job title, qualification or company" in search bars of a job portal)
- Examples for input text
- Guidelines (e.g., "Show us that you are the right person for this job" in an input field for a cover letter in a job portal)
- Remove obstacles (e.g., a combination of examples to make sure users know what input is expected)
- Having fun (e.g., "knechtruprecht@groening.742" in an input field for an email address)

## Buttons

**Just focus on the value of an action instead of the action.**

> [!note] 
> Not every button has an important value. Invest your time in relevant buttons, e.g., registration, download, etc.

## 404 Errors

The default message: *404 - Page not found*

Rules for good 404 pages:
- Explain what happened und how the user got there
- Be compassionate (users might be disappointed not to find what they were looking for)
- Show them an exit (e.g., links to a central part of the website, a search bar, etc.)
- Add a link to the homepage
- If the 404 page contains the main menu, make sure users know that they can use it to get back on track
