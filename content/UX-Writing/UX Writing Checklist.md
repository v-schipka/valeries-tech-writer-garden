Always check if your texts are:

- Understandable (use simple sentences that even a sixth-grader would understand)
- Concise (remove unnecessary words)
- Useful (only write text if it’s useful to the user)

## Best Practices

|Characteristic|Description|
|---|---|
|**Readable**|Is the text simple and not overloaded?  <br>==1 information = 1 sentence and vice versa.==|
|**Concise**|Are headlines and instruction text as short and clear as possible with no repetition, redundancy, ambiguity, or unnecessary words?|
|**Universal**|Does the word choice avoid technical jargon, idioms, and hard-to-translate phrases?|
|**Consistent**|Do text elements or UI components of the same type use the same patterns and styles (e.g., see yunIO styleguide)?  <br>Check the other products or components to make sure.|
|**User-focused**|Does the content focus on how the product will benefit users in solving their problem (and less on features or technical details)?|
|**Guiding**|Is the next required action clear?|
|**Prioritized**|If you squint at any screen, is the info hierarchy clear?  <br>Do important actions stand out?|

##  Instructions & Tooltips

|Characteristic|Description|
|---|---|
|**Informative**|Do users have enough guidance and info about consequences at every point in the flow to make a (critical) decision with confidence and continue?|
|**Supportive**|Do tooltips provide additional details for users who need help understanding?|

## Error Messages

> [!important] 
> Present the problem  from the user perspective, not the system or developer perspective.

| Characteristic    | Description                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Actionable**    | Does the error say what happened in simple terms and explain what the user needs to do next to get back on task?      |
| **Compassionate** | Do the language and the tone of the message match the severity of the issue and avoid blaming the user for the error? |

##  Notifications & Alerts

|Characteristic|Description|
|---|---|
|**Front-loaded**|Do important words / phrases appear first in the message? ==Users usually only scan the first 11 characters of a text, so it is advised to put important stuff first.==|
|**Meaningful**|Are notifications or alerts useful and relevant to the user at the moment they are presented?|
|**Consistent**|Do individual alerts and messages conform to an overall framework that uses consistent patterns for similar message types?  <br>Check other products/other messages to make sure.|
