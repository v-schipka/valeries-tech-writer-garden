Documentation is material that is used to describe, explain or instruct readers about attributes of an object, system or procedure. As a form of knowledge management / organization, documentation can be provided on paper, online, or on digital or analog media. 

My personal leitmotif for writing documentation:
> "Use as few words as possible, but as many as necessary."
