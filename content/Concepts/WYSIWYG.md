**WYSIWYG** is an acronym for **What You See Is What You Get**. Its counterpart is [[Concepts/WYSIWYM]].

It refers to software that allows content to be edited in a form that resembles its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation. WYSIWYG implies a user interface that allows the user to view something very similar to the result while the document is being created.
In general, WYSIWYG implies the ability to directly manipulate the layout of a document without having to type or remember names of layout commands

Examples:
- Microsoft [[Help Authoring Tools/Word]]
- Adobe Dreamwaver

**WYSIWYG** editors can be used for [[Concepts/Documentation]].
