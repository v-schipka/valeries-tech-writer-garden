Simplified User-Interface (SUI) graphics visually simplify unimportant details in UI [[Screenshots]]. This is done to not overwhelm users with too much irrelevant information. SUI graphics follow the K.I.S.S. principle: „Keep it simple, Stupid!“

Example:

## Advantages

- Better focus
- Easier information digest for the brain
- **Less maintenance work when details of the UI change, e.g. labels and icons**
- Independent from software language settings
- modern look and feel (less markers in the screenshots)
- (SUIs can be used in video content - at least with [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/snagit/))

> [!caution]
> Be mindful of when to use SUI graphics. They are not meant to explain complex actions or movements.

## How to Create SUI Graphics

- Make a screenshot of a  UI
- Open the screenshot in an image editing software
- Remove all non-relevant menus, buttons and tool-tips to reduce complexity
- Replace texts and UI graphics with simple geometrical elements
- Save the SUI graphic

-> Make a screenshot for the documentation, use the SUI graphic as an overlay and cut out the part of the SUI graphic that is relevant for the documentation
