SIMM is a model for evaluating and further developing the quality and intelligence of technical information. The model helps companies assess the "maturity leve" of their technical documentation and improve it with regard to the demands of digital transformation, such as:

- Modularization of content
- Content delivery via smart channels
- Context sensitivity
- Interactivity
- Personalization

### Maturity Levels

1. **Initial (Level 1)**
    - Documentation is unstructured or monolithic (e.g., PDF, Word, etc.)
    - Little to no reuse or modularization
2. **Repeatable (Level 2)**
    - Initial steps toward modularization and structuring
    - Standardized processes are starting to emerge
3. **Defined (Level 3)**
    - Content is structured, modular, and media-neutral
    - Reuse of content through content management or authoring systems
4. **Managed (Level 4)**
    - Content is delivered context-sensitively and tailored to the target audience
    - An information model exists, and metadata is used systematically
5. **Optimizing (Level 5)**
    - Use of AI, semantic networks, and adaptive delivery
    - Information is user-centered, context-aware, and automatically adapted

### Docs-as-Code Context

|SIMM Level|Docs-as-Code Tactics|Key Tools|
|---|---|---|
|Level 1|Migrate to Git/Markdown, use SSG|Git, MkDocs/Jekyll|
|Level 2|Structure content, CI/CD builds|GitHub Actions, linters, templates|
|Level 3|Modularization, metadata, reuse|MkDocs, includes/snippets|
|Level 4|Contextual delivery, filtered views, advanced search|Algolia, taxonomy, metadata filters|
|Level 5|Personalization, AI search, semantic enrichment|LLMs, schema.org, analytics, JavaScript logic|
