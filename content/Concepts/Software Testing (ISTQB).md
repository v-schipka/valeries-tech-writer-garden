According to the International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB), software testing is defined as:

**"The process of evaluating a software product to detect differences between given input and expected output, and to assess the quality of a software product."**

### Purpose of Software Testing

- **Validation**: Ensuring that the software meets the needs and expectations of the end-users.
- **Verification**: Checking that the software correctly implements the intended design and requirements.
- **Risk Management**: Identifying and reducing risks associated with software failures.

## Key Concepts

- **Evaluation of Software**: Systematic assessment of the software to ensure that it meets specified requirements and functions correctly.
- **Detection of Differences**: Identification of defects or discrepancies between how the software is supposed to work (expected outcome) and how it actually performs (actual outcome).
- **Assessment of Quality**: Measurement and improvement of the quality of the software to ensure it meets the necessary standards.
- **Process-Oriented**: Testing is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process that occurs throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Types of Testing

ISTQB categorizes testing into several types based on different criteria:

Scope:
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components or pieces of code.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing the interaction between integrated units or components.
- **System Testing**: Testing the complete system as a whole.
- **Acceptance Testing**: Testing conducted to determine if the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.

Objective:
- **Functional Testing**: Verifying that the software functions according to specified requirements.
- **Non-Functional Testing**: Testing aspects like performance, usability, reliability, etc.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensuring that new code changes do not adversely affect existing functionality.

Execution:
- **Manual Testing**: Tests are executed manually by a human tester.
- **Automated Testing**: Tests are executed automatically using tools or scripts.

### Principles of Testing

ISTQB also outlines several fundamental principles of software testing:

- **Testing shows the presence of defects:** Testing cannot prove that the software is defect-free.
- **Exhaustive testing is impossible**: It’s impossible to test all possible inputs and scenarios, so testing should be risk-based and prioritized.
- **Early testing**: Testing activities should start as early as possible in the software development lifecycle.
- **Defect clustering**: A small number of modules typically contain most of the defects.
- **Pesticide paradox**: Repeated execution of the same tests will eventually no longer find new defects, so tests need to be regularly reviewed and revised.
- **Testing is context-dependent**: Different types of software require different testing strategies and methods.
- **Absence-of-errors fallacy**: Finding and fixing defects does not guarantee that the software meets users' needs.
