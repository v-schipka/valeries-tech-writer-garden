Before you start creating video tutorials, ask yourself the following:
1. Who’s the audience?
2. What specific problem will this tutorial solve?
3. What will the audience be able to do after watching?

## Prepare Recording

- Write a script (this is for beginners, later try to use bullet points or no script at all to become more time efficient and seem more human-> unfortunately, speaking freely is a talent)
- Clean up your desktop screen by hiding your icons, choosing a neutral colored background or a branded wallpaper. 
- Close any applications you don’t need, and turn off any notifications that might pop up, including on your phone next to you.
- Open the application for the tutorial and practice walking through the steps you’ve listed in your script.
- Practice a few times until you can comfortably make it through the entire workflow, with minimal mistakes.

## Process Recording

- Remove mistakes and extra footage from the screen recording by cutting content.
- Sync the narration with the video so that what you’re saying lines up with what you’re showing.
- Use animations and annotations to call viewers’ attention to important elements (zoom in on your screen add annotations to point out or highlight important information, add text onto the screen, etc).
- If available, add an Intro and outro clip.

## Best Practices

- Compelling titles for videos are concise, descriptive, keyword-rich, and should give viewers a clear idea of what to expect from the video. Include keywords that your audience might use when searching for the information your video provides.
- Use both video and narration
- If the video is long and answers multiple questions or explain processes with several steps, add a table of content
- Emphasizing key points or steps in your tutorial helps viewers recognize the more important aspects of your video without getting lost in the details.
- Add some quiet background music!
- Add captions
- **Keep videos as short as possible. Aim for between 3–5 minutes for simple topics and up to 15–20 minutes for more complex subjects, always focusing on clarity and value.**
