**WYSIWYM** is an acronym for **What You See Is What You Mean**. Its counterpart is [[WYSIWYG]].

In a WYSIWYM editor, the user writes the contents in a structured way, marking the content according to its meaning, its significance in the document, and leaves its final appearance up to one or more separate style sheets. In essence, it aims to accurately display the contents being conveyed, rather than the actual formatting associated with it.

Examples:
- [[LaTeX]]
- [[Markdown]] with [[Static Site Generators]]
- FrameMaker

The advantage of WYSIWYM is the separation of content and presentation: since the rendering of formatting is left to the export system, this makes it easier to achieve consistency in design.

**WYSIWYM** editors can be used for [[Documentation]].
